# squaretown
minimum total travel distance (from N people)  | Algorithms | C++ | manhattan grid 

* v2 C++ file reads input from file instead of command line arguments (uses array of non constant size work with g++ extension compiler)
* original version uses dyanamic memory allocation (compatible with all c++ compilers)

*Data Input:  reads from standard input  a positive integer N (indicates how many students live in squaretown)
and it continues by reading N pairs of positive integers x y (pair indicates the position of the student's house in the grid).

*Data Output: program prints in standard output the total traveled distance (of all the the students) in order to reach the meeting point.

*Restrictions:  
    *  3 <= N <= 5*10^5  ,  2<= M <= 10^7  (M: M horizontal and vertical  roads in the grid)
    *  Memory limit: 64 MB
    *  Time limit: 1sec
